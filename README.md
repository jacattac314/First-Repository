# AI Platform Architecture Portfolio

Platform design and systems thinking for AI operations at scale.

## Case Studies

### [🧭 Central Control Plane for All Agents](docs/agent-control-plane.md)

A unified operational platform to observe, control, govern, and evolve AI agents in production.

**Key capabilities:**
- Agent registry and lifecycle management
- Real-time execution monitoring
- Policy enforcement and governance
- Cost optimization and performance tracking
- Human-in-the-loop workflows

**What it demonstrates:**
- Systems thinking for AI operations
- Production-grade platform design
- Risk management and governance
- Incremental delivery strategy

This is how automation graduates from scripts to managed infrastructure.

## Architecture Philosophy

These designs prioritize:
- **Pragmatic incrementalism** over big-bang platforms
- **Observable systems** over black-box automation
- **Governed deployment** over move-fast-break-things
- **Business outcomes** over technical complexity

Built for operators who need AI to be infrastructure, not experiments.
